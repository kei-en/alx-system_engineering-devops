# Web infrastructure design

This project spanned a week, during which I focused on extensive research on web infrastructure design. I diligently explored various design principles and utilized whiteboard diagrams to visualize the evolution of a web infrastructure. The process commenced with a basic LAMP model and concluded with the development of a comprehensive, distributed, monitored, and securely designed system.

The project files are organized with each corresponding whiteboard diagram linked accordingly.
